This repository contains a small project developed in Java, which is a default implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
TRIS: 
Tic-tac-toe is a hugely popular full-information abstract pencil and paper game. It is played on a 3x3 square grid.
In turn, the players choose an empty cell and draw a symbol (usually a player has his symbol as an "X" and the opponent a circle). The player who manages to arrange three of his symbols in a straight horizontal, vertical or diagonal line wins. If the grid is filled without either player completing a straight line of three symbols, the game ends in a draw. In the event that the game ends in a draw, the game is called a "draw", as in the game of chess.
Tic-tac-toe was the first game in history to be played by a computer, the program was OXO, developed for the EDSAC computer (1952).
